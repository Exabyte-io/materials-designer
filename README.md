# Materials Designer

A standalone React application for atomistic structural design. Deployed within the Mat3ra.com platform as
documented [here](https://docs.mat3ra.com/materials-designer/overview/) and can be used as a library in any web/Node.js
application.

## 1. Installation

### 1.1. From source

Materials Designer can be installed from the source as follows:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mat3ra/materials-designer.git
```

Or use https, if no SSH authentication is set up with GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mat3ra/materials-designer.git
```

then start the application using Node v20.18:

```bash
cd materials-designer
npm install
npm start
```

> Some files might not be downloaded by `git clone` or `git pull` commands if your system doesn't have `git-lfs`
> installed.
> To fix this run (on OSX):
> ```
> brew install git-lfs
> git lfs pull
> ```

Open http://localhost:3001 to view the application in the browser.

### 1.2. Using Docker

See the Docker Files section below.

## 2. Functionality

### 2.1. Current Functionality

As documented [here](https://docs.mat3ra.com/materials-designer/overview/):

    - Export materials in JSON/POSCAR formats
- Edit Menu
    - Undo/Redo/Reset/Clone operations

    - Fullscreen mode
    - Multi-material Editor (combining multiple materials into one)
- Advanced Menu
    - Creating supercells
    - Creating surfaces/slabs
    - Creating combinatorial sets
    - Creating interpolated sets
    - Run Python Script
    - Launch a Jupyter Lite session
- Basis Editor
    - Adding/Removing/Modifying sites
    - Adding/Removing/Modifying atomic constraints
    - Switching Crystal/Cartesian units
- Lattice Editor
    - Adjusting lattice units/types/parameters
- 3D Editor
    - Visualizing materials
        - Rotation
        - Repetition/Radius
        - Toggle axes
    - Adjusting materials
        - add/remove/select atoms
        - multiple selection with drag-and-drop

### 2.2. TODO list

Desirable features/fixes for implementation.

General Improvements:

- switch the color back to white when the material is back to the original after editing
- show the total number of materials in the list and the current index
- fix fullscreen support
- add lattice vectors form to change lattice vectors in a 3x3 matrix with all components explicitly:
- highlight atoms that are selected in the source editor in the 3D editor and vice versa
- add the ability to drop files with material structural data to the materials list
    - ESSE JSON and POSCAR parsers already implemented in made.js
    - add a skeleton material with (+) button to the materials list (combines functionality of "Edit" -> "Clone" and "
      I/O" -> "Import...")
- save the state of Materials Designer to share materials and exact visualization via URL link.
    - the idea is to be able to share an exact copy of the state of the application
    - materials data is stored in the redux store
    - visualization settings stored in wave.js components, via `useState()` hook

Specific features:

- add logic for Interstitials and vacancy concentrations in combinatorial sets

Developer Experience:

- add tests for all the functionality listed above. We only test advanced operations at current.
- fix modal dialog exceptions for AdvancedGeometryDialog
- remove the `updateIndex` action when the index is the same

## 3. Development

### 3.1. Run the application

Execute the following commands when running the application in development mode. Use Node v14.19

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### 3.2. Tests

Tests are implemented using Cypress. To launch it use Node v20 and run:

```bash
cd tests
npm install
npm test
```

To run a specific test feature, pass its relative path as an option:

```bash
sh run-tests.sh -f=menu/advanced/create-supercell.feature
```

### 3.3. Dependencies

This package depends on [Made](https://github.com/mat3ra/made), [Wave](https://github.com/mat3ra/wave.js),
and [Cove.js](https://github.com/mat3ra/cove) among other packages. For the full list,
see [package.json](package.json).

### 3.4. CI Docker files

The first `dockerfiles/app/Dockerfile` builds and runs the application. The second `dockerfiles/tests/Dockerfile` provisions and runs the tests. 

Provided `docker compose` is installed, it can be used like so:

```bash
docker compose build materials-designer
docker compose build materials-designer-test

docker compose up -d materials-designer
sleep 30  # let the app actually start
docker compose run materials-designer-test
```

To run tests in the container use default profile by not specifying it:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

To run on MacOS, add CYPRESS_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3001 to the environment variables in the test container

```
CYRPRESS_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3001 docker compose run materials-designer-test
```

To run both services and execute tests:

```
CYPRESS_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3001 docker compose up --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from materials-designer-test
```

For debugging purposes, Materials Designer and test container can be run interactively with access via VNC:

```bash
docker compose --profile use-vnc up -d --build
```

Then connect to `vnc://localhost:5920` with a VNC client. The password is `123`. (Port set in `.env` file.)
Make sure to have VNC client installed on the system, when address is typed in the Chrome browser, the VNC prompt will
appear.

### 3.5. Using Cove.js for local development

If need to link Cove.js into the app for local development, you need

1. Add the local path of Cove.js to package.json

```bash
    "@mat3ra/cove": "file:../../cove.js"
```

2. Run the app

```bash
    npm start
```

If you need to re-link it again, remove node_modules in cove.js and the app, run npm install, then run npm start again.
### 3.6. Running tests for JupyterLite Notebooks

To run tests for JupyterLite Notebooks, set the environment variable in `.env` file.
And update the URL for JL dev distribution by getting the URL from the JupyterLite PR preview.

```bash
VITE_USE_JUPYTERLITE_DEV_URL=true
VITE_JUPYTERLITE_DEVELOPMENT_URL="https://deploy-preview-56--mat3ra-jupyterlite.netlify.app"
```

This should source JL from the development distribution and run only notebook healthcheck tests.

### 3.7. Python REPL (Pyodide)

The **View → Python REPL** panel embeds the [pyodide-repl](https://github.com/mat3ra/pyodide-repl)
page in an iframe and talks to it over the same data bridge as the JupyterLite session. All Pyodide
and Python concerns — the interpreter, the package environment, the wheels — live in that page and
ship with its deploy; this app only answers `get-data` with its materials (`{ materials,
selectedIndex }`) and merges the page's `set-data` payloads (`{ syncScope, entities }`) via the
`materialsSyncScope` reducer: round-tripped ids upsert in place, REPL-created materials replace the
previous `python-repl` batch, hand-made materials are never touched.

The page's origin comes from `VITE_PYODIDE_REPL_URL` (defaults to the production deploy). To develop
against a local build:

```bash
# in pyodide-repl:                    # in materials-designer:
npm run build                          VITE_PYODIDE_REPL_URL=http://localhost:3021 npm start
npx vite preview --port 3021 --host
```

Test: `tests/cypress/e2e/repl/python-repl.feature` (tagged `@ignore` until a shared deploy of the
page exists for CI to embed; run it locally with the two servers above).
