# MD 2.0 MVP — what was built, what it proved, what it cost

Companion to [`PROPOSAL.md`](PROPOSAL.md). Written at the end of the build session so the
estimate in §14.1 can be checked against what actually happened.

**Where it lives:** `src/v2/`, served at `/v2.html` by the existing dev server (`npm start`).
*(Historical. The flip made 2.0 the application: it is `src/`, served at `/`.)*
The v1 app at `/` is untouched — verified running, 6 menus, `window.MDState` intact, no console
errors — so the Cypress suite keeps passing and the platform embed contract is unchanged.

---

## 1. What the MVP set out to test

The proposal rests on one claim: **making every edit a recorded operation** dissolves v1's two
competing undo stacks, makes provenance visible, and turns transforms into previewable,
non-blocking panels. That is cheap to falsify in code and expensive to argue about on paper.

**It holds.** The evidence is `tests/playwright/md2-smoke.mjs` — 23 checks driving a real browser
against the real domain layer (made.js maths, wave.js WebGL, cove) — plus 29 unit tests over the
spine. Both suites are green. The load-bearing checks:

| Claim | How it is checked |
|---|---|
| Every edit is one recorded step | A supercell applied through a panel and a conventional-cell edit from the Inspector each add exactly one Timeline chip |
| One history, whatever the surface | The same `Cmd+Z` undoes both, in order, and stops at the origin; `Shift+Cmd+Z` redoes |
| Preview before commit | The panel reads `→ 2 → 16 atoms · 1 material` before Apply, and the viewport stays visible and orbitable while configuring |
| Sets are lineage, not list spam | A combinatorial batch collapses into one folder row under its source, and **one** undo removes the whole batch |
| Three projections, one selection | Clicking an atom in the 3D canvas updates the app's status bar (`1 of 2 selected`) |
| Steps stay live (parametric) | Editing a supercell from 2×2×2 to 3×3×3 re-runs the conventional-cell step after it (16 → 54 atoms), replaces the step in place, and one undo restores the log exactly |
| The recipe is the artifact | The Console's Script tab renders the log as runnable Python |
| Structures can get in and out | A material exported as JSON and re-imported comes back with its provenance starting at the import step |
| A refresh does not cost the session | Reload restores 16 atoms and says so, with a "Start fresh" escape |
| One token set, two themes | Light theme renders across the app chrome |

## 2. What shipped

**Spine** (`src/v2/state/`, 29 unit tests) — `Operation`/`MaterialDoc`/`Change` types; a registry
wrapping made.js (supercell, surface, boundary conditions, conventional cell, periodicity, basis,
lattice, manual patch, origins, set markers) with `label`/`digest`/`predict`; `replay(log, upTo)`
with identity-keyed caching; pure session reducers with one undo stack, gesture coalescing, fork,
revert-to-step and set-producing composites; localStorage autosave of **logs, not structures**
(a 432-atom supercell costs a 3×3 matrix on disk — asserted at < 8 KB).

**Shell** (`src/v2/shell/`) — Workspace Bar, Navigator (lineage tree + set folders + revert-aware
modified dot), Viewport (wave.js via `onEditCommit`), Timeline (chips, engine badges, deltas,
revert, fork), Inspector (structure facts, conventional cell, periodicity, basis text), Console
dock (Script + Log live), Status Bar, and one token set for dark/light.

**Panels** (`src/v2/panels/`, `src/v2/shell/*Panel.tsx`) — Supercell, Slab/Surface, Boundary
conditions, Combinatorial set, Standard library; each with v1's defaults and validation plus a
predicted result. Catalog-lite with engine badges and disabled-with-reason entries.

**Editing the past** — a chip's `✎ edit` re-opens its panel pre-filled and configured against the
state that step originally ran on; Apply replaces the step and replays what follows, with the
button naming the cost. Steps that cannot survive an upstream change are marked stale, disabled
and skipped, so the material still resolves and the loss is visible rather than silent.

**File I/O** — import via the app menu, the Catalog, or dropping files anywhere on the window
(JSON and POSCAR, the formats made.js implements); export the active material or all of them.
Import is an origin operation carrying the payload, so provenance starts at the file.

## 3. What was deliberately left out

Ghost-atom previews (the panels predict numerically, they do not render the result); the
Assistant; share links and named sessions beyond a single autosave; the read-only viewer and
picker modes; editable lattice fields with symmetry locking; the 3×3 vector form; NEB
interpolation; zip bundling for multi-export; REPL and Notebook docking (both are labelled
not-wired in the Console rather than faked). Stale-step resolution is automatic (skip with a
marker) rather than the design's explicit re-map / skip / fork choice.

## 4. Findings that change the plan

1. **`onEditCommit` and `onSelectionChanged` already exist in the pinned wave.js (`2026.8.19-0`).**
   The proposal treated adopting them as future work and the earlier UIUX plan treated a wave
   release as a P0 gate. Neither is true: the canvas/app contract is available today, and v1
   simply never used it (it still listens on the legacy `onUpdate`). **This removes the MVP's
   biggest external dependency.**
2. **Wave still owns chrome the app should own.** There is no prop to hide its toolbar or its
   internal undo/redo buttons, so the MVP defensively ignores `onEditCommit` with
   `source: undo|redo` — MD's history stays authoritative, but a user pressing wave's own undo
   button will desync the canvas from the app until the next prop push. Fixing this properly
   needs a wave-side prop (`chrome`/`showToolbar`/`historyMode`). **This is now the only
   wave-side ask, and it is smaller than the "extract all chrome" spike the proposal sized.**
3. **Wave does not follow host theming.** It wraps itself in its own dark theme, so in light mode
   the canvas stays dark. Cosmetic in the MVP, but the mode matrix promises host-token theming
   for embeds, so it belongs in the same wave-side conversation as (2).
4. **Selection has wave-side preconditions.** Picking requires the viewer to be interactive *and*
   in edit mode. The design's "click an atom, see its basis line" needs the app to drive those
   modes rather than leaving them to the user — a small addition, but it was not in the plan.
5. **`CombinatorialBasis` returns bare arrays.** Its configs carry plain `elements`/`coordinates`
   with no lattice, so children must be rebuilt via `Basis.fromElementsAndCoordinates` against the
   source cell — exactly what v1's dialog did. Passing the raw config to `new Material(...)` fails
   schema validation at replay. Any set-producing operation needs this adapter.
6. **ESSE schemas must be registered before any `toJSON()`/`clone()`.** Unit tests need the same
   bootstrap the standalone host does; without it replay fails with
   `ESSE schema not found: material-enhanced-hashed`. Worth documenting for anyone testing
   made.js in isolation.
7. **Recorded results go stale when a log is rewritten.** Editing a past step recomputes the
   material but not the digests already stored on later chips — the timeline then reports atom
   counts from a history that no longer exists. Caught by driving the app, not by the unit tests,
   which is an argument for keeping the browser suite in the loop; both suites now cover it. Any
   future log-rewriting feature (disable a step, reorder, flatten) needs the same recomputation.
8. **`eslint --fix` rewrites relative test imports into unresolvable package paths.** It turned
   `../../../src/v2/state/...` into `@mat3ra/materials-designer/src/v2/state/...`, which vitest
   cannot resolve. Harmless once known, but worth a lint override for `tests/` before anyone runs
   `--fix` over the test tree.
9. **The lint gate does not see `.jsx`, but does see `.ts(x)`.** The bugfix memo on #299 predicted
   this; writing v2 in TypeScript meant the pre-commit hook caught four real errors (including a
   use-before-define and a strict-null violation) that the equivalent `.jsx` files would have
   sailed past. An argument for the TS migration independent of the redesign.
10. **The MVP had no design language, and neither did anything upstream.** The palette it shipped
    with was improvised, and on inspection turned out to be GitHub Primer's (`#0d1117`, `#3fb950`,
    `#f85149`) — not Mat3ra's. That was not laziness so much as a vacuum: cove ships one violet plus
    stock MUI with `paletteDark` structurally missing every surface, text and border value (v1
    therefore renders on stock MUI `#121212` and routes around the gap via `palette.grey[800]`),
    wave.js hard-codes its own nested theme, and no tokens, storybook or brand guide exists in any
    `@mat3ra` package. The brand itself lived only on the marketing site. Closed by
    [DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md](./DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md) — *Mat3rial D3sign* — with `src/v2/styles/tokens.ts`
    as the single source of truth for the CSS variables, the MUI theme and the mockups, and a
    contrast suite that fails the build on an unreadable hex. Two of its assertions immediately
    caught real defects (light-mode accent at 4.45:1 on hover rows; selection cyan indistinguishable
    from the success green in light mode), which is the argument for making a design language
    executable rather than a PDF.

## 5. What the review caught

A high-effort review of the finished branch found **fifteen real defects** — four of them data
loss or dead ends (a failed autosave deleting the last good save; an unreplayable stored session
white-screening every load; a cancelled drag leaving an overlay over the whole app; the basis
editor discarding typing when an edit was rejected), plus a correctness bug that would destroy any
cartesian structure edited through the basis field, and a handful of interaction faults (a menu
that could not close itself, a set folder that could not be re-collapsed). All are fixed, with
regression tests for the ones that could recur silently.

Two things are worth carrying forward from that:

- **The browser suite caught what the unit tests could not, and vice versa.** The stale-digest bug
  only appeared by driving the app; the autosave and units bugs only appeared by reasoning about
  the code. Neither suite alone was sufficient.
- **Freshly written code that passes its own tests is not reviewed code.** Every one of these
  defects survived a green suite. Budget review time for the real phases; do not read the speed in
  §5 as evidence that the review step can be skipped.

## 6. Effort, measured against the estimate

§14.1 priced the MVP at **9–10 engineer-weeks**, with a note that this team's AI-assisted mode
might reach 3–4 calendar weeks. This session produced the spine, the shell, six panels, the
catalog, sets, the standard library, editing-the-past with replay, file import/export, 35 unit
tests and a 32-check browser suite in **roughly two and a half hours of agent time** (one parallel
subagent for the panels).

The honest reading is not "the estimate was 20× too high":

- The **Cypress migration (1–1.5 wks)** was avoided entirely, not done, by building beside v1
  rather than replacing it. It comes due the moment v2 becomes the default.
- Ghost previews, replay-of-past-steps and the notebook/REPL docking — the parts that need care
  rather than typing — are all still ahead.
- What was written is a **skeleton that stands up**, not a shippable product: no error taxonomy,
  no perf work on large structures, thin a11y, no design QA, no review.

A fair revision: the *scaffolding* is far cheaper than estimated; the *finishing* is not. Plan
Phase 0 + Phase 1 in days rather than weeks, and keep the original estimate for everything with a
correctness or UX-quality bar attached — the fifteen defects in §5 are what "finishing" means, and
they cost about a quarter of the build time to find and fix on a codebase this small.

## 7. How to run it

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps     # CI uses the same flag
npm start                          # v1 at /, MD 2.0 at /v2.html
npm run test:unit                  # 35 spine tests
npm run test:md2-smoke             # 32 browser checks (needs the dev server up)
```
