# Test hooks — the contract between the UI and the suites

v1's specs reach the UI by walking menus: `selectMenuItemByNameAndItemNumber("Advanced", 6)`. MD 2.0
retires the menu bar, so that coupling has to go — but it must go *without* changing anything other
repositories can see.

## What is frozen

web-app's Cypress suite globs MD's step definitions out of `node_modules`; **62 of its feature files
invoke MD's Gherkin phrases**, and its `MaterialDesignerWidget` subclasses ours. So these are a
published API:

- **The 57 Gherkin phrases**, verbatim, including their data-table column names (`| name | basis |`).
- **File paths** under `tests/cypress/support/step_definitions/` and `tests/cypress/support/widgets/`.
- **Public method names** on the widgets.
- **`window.MDState`'s shape** — `{ index, isLoading, materials, updatedIndices }`.

Phrases known to be used by web-app, with the number of its features that use each:
`I Run All Cells` (29) · `I create materials with the following data` (17) · `I upload files` (11) ·
`I see material designer page` (5) · `I create a surface with the following data` (3) ·
`I open Standata dialog` (2) · `I add boundary conditions with the following data` (1).

`scripts/check-test-contract.sh` fails CI on a rename or deletion in those directories unless a
commit on the branch says `[contract-change]`.

## What is free

Every **step-definition body** and every selector. Retargeting
`I create materials with the following data` from a menu walk to a command ID is invisible to those
62 features — which is the whole reason the cutover is safe.

## Command IDs

One registry in `src/shell/commands.ts`. Every trigger — menu item, palette row, toolbar button,
keyboard shortcut — carries `data-command="<id>"`, and `CommandsWidget.run(id)` is how specs invoke
one. IDs are stable; labels are not.

| Group | IDs |
|---|---|
| File | `file.import` · `file.save` · `file.exit` · `file.export-json` · `file.export-poscar` · `file.export-all` |
| Edit | `edit.undo` · `edit.redo` |
| Material | `material.new` · `material.clone` · `material.rename` · `material.remove` · `material.next` · `material.previous` |
| Create | `create.standard-library` · `create.from-file` |
| Operations | `op.supercell` · `op.surface` · `op.boundary-conditions` · `op.combinatorial-set` · `op.interpolated-set` |
| Structure | `structure.conventional-cell` · `structure.toggle-periodicity` |
| History | `history.revert-origin` · `history.edit-step` · `history.fork` |
| Console | `console.toggle` · `console.script` · `console.log` · `console.notebook` · `console.repl` |
| View | `view.toggle-navigator` · `view.toggle-timeline` · `view.toggle-inspector` · `view.toggle-console` · `view.theme` |
| Global | `global.palette` · `global.shortcuts` |

A command that cannot run reports why: `data-command-disabled-reason` carries the text, which is
what `toolbar/control-availability.feature` asserts.

## Test IDs

Regions: `data-testid="workspace-bar" | "navigator" | "viewport" | "timeline" | "inspector" |
"console-dock" | "status-bar" | "catalog" | "command-palette"`.

Rows and panels: `material-row-<index>` (1-based, the material's real index — it does **not**
renumber under a filter, which `materials-list/filter-and-count.feature` checks explicitly) ·
`timeline-chip-<step>` · `panel-<operation-type>` · `panel-apply` · `panel-cancel` ·
`console-<tab>` · `status-<group>`.

Preserved from v1 because existing specs select them: `#jupyter-lite-iframe` (and every JupyterLab
selector inside it) · `data-tid="materials-in-selector" | "materials-out-selector" | "select-material"` ·
`#basis-xyz` · both `#materials-designer` (MD's own `Page.ts`) and `.materials-designer`
(web-app's widget).

## Rule

A spec never selects by tag name, CSS class, DOM position, or visible label. Classes are styling and
change with the design language; labels change with the copy; positions change with the layout.
Command IDs and test IDs are the only supported handles, and they are chosen so that the flip is a
change of implementation rather than a change of contract.

## Running the specs (added 2026-09-06, rewritten at the flip)

There is one application and one suite:

```
cd tests && npx cypress run
```

Until the flip, `cypress/support/app.ts` chose between two applications with `--env APP=v2` and
`forApp(v1, v2)`, and the specs that only 2.0 could pass were tagged `@parity_2_0` and excluded by
default. Both are gone: v1 is deleted, `/v2.html` is `/`, the 2.0 branch is inlined at each of the
switch's fourteen consumers, and every spec runs by default.

Two environment notes, both of which cost an afternoon to discover:

- **The Cypress binary needs a resumable download here.** `npm install` fetched 188 MB of a 200 MB
  archive and failed the checksum. `curl -C - --retry` completed it, and the checksum then matched
  exactly — the artefact was fine, the transfer was not. Install with
  `CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=/path/to/cypress.zip npx cypress install`.
- **Fixtures are Git LFS objects.** A clone made with `GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1`, or one where the
  smudge filter did not run, leaves them as pointer stubs, and specs fail with `cy.readFile ...
  failed` on a file that is plainly present. `git lfs pull` fixes it. CI checks out with
  `lfs: true`, so this only bites locally.
- **The viewport needs software rendering.** A headless container has no GPU, so wave.js fails on
  "Error creating WebGL context" before any assertion runs. `cypress.config.ts` now passes
  `--use-gl=swiftshader` for chromium browsers, which is what the Playwright smoke already did.
- **The notebook health-checks cannot run in this sandbox.** `https://jupyterlite.mat3ra.com`
  answers 200 to `curl`, but a browser's tunnel through the agent proxy is reset
  (`net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET`), so the frame never loads. CI's Docker job is the authority for the
  53 `@notebook_healthcheck` features; locally, everything on MD's side of the bridge is covered by
  the smoke checks below, which speak the protocol at the app the way the frame would.

## What the parity specs say today

Run against 2.0 on 2026-09-06: **26 passing, 0 failing** — every harvested spec is green.

| Spec | Result |
|---|---|
| `toolbar/command-palette` | 4/4 |
| `toolbar/control-availability` | 3/3 |
| `toolbar/keyboard-shortcuts` | 3/3 |
| `toolbar/quick-actions` | 3/3 |
| `status-bar/status-bar` | 1/1 |
| `materials-list/filter-and-count` | 6/6 |
| `materials-list/updated-marker` | 2/2 |
| `source-editor/basis-table` | 4/4 |

They started at 3 passing. Closing the other 23 needed six product gaps filled — `window.MDState`,
the clone's name, the basis editor, the lattice form, the list's add menu, and the palette — plus
one crash the specs exposed that nothing else had: a Standard-library config carries an `external`
block that made.js accepts on the way in and rejects when serialising, so importing one and then
publishing `MDState` took the whole app down.


## Console › Notebook (added 2026-09-06)

The notebook surface keeps v1's DOM contract on purpose, so the 53 generated health-check features
and the four `.ftl` templates need **no change at all** — one step body moved, and nothing else:

| Handle | Where it is now |
|---|---|
| `#jupyterlite-transformation-dialog` | the Notebook tab's root |
| `iframe#jupyter-lite-iframe` | `kit/BridgedIframe`, opened at `made/Introduction.ipynb` |
| `[data-tid='materials-in-selector']` / `[data-tid='materials-out-selector']` | `domain/console/MaterialsSelector` |
| `[data-tid='select-material']`, `.MuiChip-root`, `.MuiAutocomplete-popper` | unchanged MUI markup |
| `#jupyterlite-transformation-dialog-submit-button` | the "Add to session" button |

What changed, and why each change was safe:

- `I open JupyterLite Transformation dialog` now calls
  `MaterialDesignerWidget.openJupyterLiteTransformation()`, which runs `console.notebook` under
  `APP=v2` and keeps the Advanced-menu path for v1. The phrase and the widget's method names are
  untouched.
- `I select materials in MaterialsSelector` clears the selection instead of removing a chip named
  "Silicon FCC". The old body assumed the surface always opened on the first material in the list;
  2.0 opens on the material you are looking at.
- `deselectAllMaterials()` removes the first chip and re-queries until none are left. Chip labels
  carry their own position (`0: Silicon FCC`), so collecting names up front and deleting them one
  by one worked for a single chip and silently missed the rest.

Two behaviours are load-bearing rather than cosmetic, both because the templates open the surface
up to three times in one scenario and assert `Introduction.ipynb` each time: the frame is mounted
only while the tab is showing, and "Add to session" closes the console. Together they reproduce
what a modal did by being unmounted.

## Reaching a command that has no button (added 2026-09-06)

Most operations have no permanent trigger — that is the point of a registry. `CommandsWidget.run`
therefore looks in three places, in the order a person would:

1. a visible `[data-command="<id>"]` — the quick-action row, the panel toggles, the console tabs;
2. the **Catalog**, opened by clicking, whose cards now carry the id of the command they are the
   face of;
3. the **command palette**, which lists the whole registry, for everything else — undo, reset,
   the view toggles.

The palette is opened for (3) by dispatching the chord at the document rather than typing it.
`cy.type` sends keys to whatever holds focus and the registry ignores chords typed into a field —
correctly, and `toolbar/keyboard-shortcuts` exists to pin that. A step whose intent is "run this
command" should not fail because the previous step left the cursor in a text box, so
`CommandPaletteWidget` has both: `openWithShortcut()` for the keyboard specs and `open()` for
everything else.

Two conventions came out of this, and both replace a bespoke id per dialog:

- every operation panel is `#panel-<type>` (`#panel-supercell`, `#panel-boundary-conditions`, …),
  rendered by `PanelFrame` from the operation it configures;
- its footer buttons are `[data-testid="panel-apply"]` and `[data-testid="panel-cancel"]`.

## What the v1 suite says against 2.0

The eight specs CI actually gates on, run with `--env APP=v2`. All eight pass, with **no feature
file changed** — only step-definition bodies and widget selectors, which is the whole point of
freezing the phrases rather than the implementation.

Closing them turned up seven defects that nothing else had caught — every one in the product,
not in the specs:

| What the spec found | Where it was |
|---|---|
| A step could be recorded that produced a material nothing could serialise. made.js validates lazily, so `apply` succeeded and the 3D view crashed several frames later, cloning it on a prop change. | `core/session.ts` — the write path now serialises before recording, so the edit is refused with a reason instead |
| Set children were appended to the end of the list; v1 inserted them after the material they came from, which is what the fixtures count on | `core/session.ts` |
| The standard library listed file names (`C-[Graphene]-HEX_[P6%2Fmmm]…json`) instead of material names | `domain/StandataPanel.tsx` |
| Choosing a Bravais type left the previous type's angles in the form, producing a lattice that contradicted its own symmetry | `domain/inspector/LatticeForm.tsx` |
| Reset reverted the active material; v1's Reset restored the whole session and emptied the undo stack | new `edit.reset` command |
| Clearing the basis text box committed a material with no atoms | `domain/inspector/BasisEditor.tsx` |
| `external` was being stripped from every imported config on the theory that made.js could not serialise it. It can: exactly **one** of the seventy-three library entries names an `external.source` outside the schema's enum, and dropping the block from all of them cost the other seventy-two the provenance the specs assert on | `core/io.ts` — `toImportableConfig` now drops it only when it is what makes the config unusable, with a test that pins the count |

## Porting the browser smoke into Cypress (added 2026-09-06)

The Playwright smoke was the MVP's oracle because Chromium happened to be pre-installed; the plan
always had it becoming Cypress features so CI would run them. What it covered and nothing else did
is now six features, all `@parity_2_0` because they describe behaviour v1 does not have:

| Feature | What it pins |
|---|---|
| `timeline/edit-a-past-step` | a transform is forecast before it is applied; editing step 2 replaces it in place, replays what follows, and costs one undo |
| `timeline/one-undo-stack` | an edit from a panel and an edit from the Inspector are one history — v1 had two stacks |
| `session/autosave-and-restore` | work survives a reload, the app says it was restored, and "start fresh" discards it |
| `sets/combinatorial` | a batch folds into one set folder beside its source and one Cmd+Z removes it |
| `console/repl` | switching console tabs leaves exactly one frame mounted |
| `menu/input-output/import-review-cancel` | nothing enters the session until you say so |
| `session/drag-and-drop` | a drop imports directly; a drag that leaves takes its overlay with it |

Three things learned writing them, all worth keeping:

- **The save chip cannot gate a reload.** It reads "Saved · just now" for the save *before* a change
  as readily as the one after, so a spec that waits for it still races the debounce. The step reads
  the autosaved payload instead, which is both a reliable wait and the assertion the scenario is
  actually about.
- **`CombinatorialPanel` was the one panel not on the `#panel-<type>` convention** — it predates
  `PanelFrame` and rolled its own footer. It carries the id and the `panel-apply` / `panel-cancel`
  hooks now, so every panel is addressed the same way.
- **Two step definitions can claim the same sentence, and only a run finds out.** A new
  `I do not see the {string} panel` for operation panels collided with the existing one for
  regions, and cucumber reported it on `toolbar/quick-actions` — a spec that had nothing to do with
  either change. `scripts/check-test-contract.sh` now fails on a duplicate phrase, so the clash is
  caught where it was written.

The Playwright script stays until the remaining checks (viewport selection sync, drag-and-drop,
theme) have features of their own; it is not in CI, and `npm run test:md2-smoke` runs it locally.

## Both suites, side by side (historical — the flip merged them)

Run on 2026-09-08, the last time both applications existed, immediately before the flip:

```
# MD 2.0 — everything CI would gate on, harvested specs included
npx cypress run --env APP=v2,TAGS='not @ignore and not @quarantine and not @notebook_healthcheck'
                                                        # 114 tests: 57 passing, 0 failing, 57 pending

# v1 — what CI ran, unchanged
npx cypress run --env TAGS='... and not @parity_2_0'    # 114 tests: 8 passing, 0 failing, 106 pending
```

The pending are the tag-filtered health-checks and the `@ignore`d specs, exactly as in CI.

That v1 passed to the end is the point, and it is what closed gate 1: every change was additive, and
the same step definitions drove both applications until the flip removed the need for the switch.

**Run them sequentially, not concurrently.** Two Cypress runs against one dev server produced a
`menu/advanced/supercell.feature` failure that died in one second and passed in eleven on its own.
That was the only red in the whole cutover that was not a real defect, and it cost a diagnosis.

## The stylesheet must not touch the host (added 2026-09-08)

`src/embed/MaterialsDesignerContainer.tsx` side-effect-imports `src/styles/md2.css`, so every rule
in that file lands in web-app's document. Until this was split, md2.css opened with `* {}`,
`html, body, #root {}` and `body { background: var(--bg0) }` — rendered inside the platform, that
repainted its page navy, changed its base font and restyled every button on it.

Two stylesheets now, and the line between them is what an embed loads:

- **`src/styles/page.css`** — the reset, the root sizing, the page background, and the `:root`
  tokens. Imported **only** by the standalone entry. A host never sees it.
- **`src/styles/md2.css`** — everything the app itself needs, with every selector under `.md2-app`,
  which also carries the token declarations. The `.md2-app` wrapper paints its own ground, colour
  and type, because `body` is no longer ours to paint.

Three checks hold the line, and they fail in different ways on purpose:

```
npx vitest run tests/vitest/v2/design-language.test.ts   # rejects any md2.css selector outside .md2-,
                                                         # and any mention of :root at all
npm start
npm run test:host-leak                                   # mounts the real component in a host page
```

`tests/playwright/host-leak.mjs` is the browser half. It does not diff computed styles — it asks
Chrome, over CDP, *which stylesheet supplies each declaration on the host's own elements*, and
fails when the answer is one of ours. That distinction matters, because a plain before/after diff
fails on something that is not ours to fix:

> `@mat3ra/wave.js/dist/index.js` imports a stylesheet setting
> `body { font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0; overflow: hidden }`.
> Any importer of wave.js gets it — v1's `ThreeDEditorFullscreen` included — so the platform has
> lived with it since long before 2.0. The check prints it as a NOTE and does not assert on it.

It also checks the two things the `.md2-app` scoping could plausibly break: that nothing of ours
renders outside the wrapper (a portalled menu would lose every variable), and that every element
carrying an `md2-` class resolves `--bg1`.
